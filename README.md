## Editing Content

The content of pages and posts is stored in the 'content' directory as a set of markdown files with a yaml front-matter, except for the 'proceedings' page (under 'pages').
Static assets (documents and images) are stored in the 'static' directory.

## Development instructions

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn # Or npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
