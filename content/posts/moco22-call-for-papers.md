### 8th International Conference on Movement and Computing

### 22-25 June 2022, Chicago, Illinois, USA.

**Website:** https://moco22.movementcomputing.org/

This Year’s Theme is _Windy Shifts_

---

In collaboration with our host, Columbia College Chicago, we are pleased to invite submissions for paper presentations, performances, workshops and more to the 8th International Conference on Movement and Computing (MOCO) which will be held 22nd-25th June in Chicago, IL.

MOCO is a conference aiming to better understand how bodily movement interacts with computational technology. This year’s theme is Artificial Embodiment: _Windy Shifts_. Wind chaotically rippling across the prairies of Illinois has a wildly different characteristic movement than the linear predictability of the Shift key on a computer keyboard. Yet, both result in a transformation of the landscape, an opening of new possibilities. Referencing the famed winds of the midwest where our conference event takes place alongside an oft-used keyboard affordance (through which many attendees may access the event), this theme highlights human physical intelligence and the artificial systems that attempt to measure and recreate it.

We are curious about which aspects of the moving human can and cannot be measured, as well as those that can and cannot be represented in artificial systems. For example, telepresence robots that attempt to give remote humans physical presence in work, social, or public physical spaces are a type of artificial embodiment that grapples with natural and artificial modalities of movement. These are just some examples of technologies that we may be shifting toward due to the prevailing winds of current events that necessitate interaction at a distance. We are excited to explore these concepts in person and online at Columbia College in Chicago this coming June.

### Submissions

MOCO is an interdisciplinary community where artistic and technical contributions are synergistic and equally valued. Thus, we invite submissions that span academic approaches, applied practices, and fields of study, unified by the concepts of movement and computing. We encourage submitters to carefully articulate the relationship of their work to this lens through both scientific and artistic methods of inquiry. Topics include, but are not limited to:

- Cultural movement practices and technology
- Dance and technology
- Entrainment and movement
- Embodied cognition and movement
- Embodied interaction
- Full body interaction
- Gesture and sound
- Glitch feminism
- Individual and group movement capture
- Interactive, experiential performances and installations
- Learning detection through bodily movement
- Machine learning for movement
- Mechanisms of coordination dynamics
- Movement analysis and analytics
- Movement as a proxy of human brain
- Movement in social interaction
- Movement computation in education
- Movement computation in ergonomics, sports, and health
- Movement computation and race
- Movement expression in virtual humans and robots
- Movement notation systems (e.g. Laban or Eshkol-Wachman)
- Music and movement
- Philosophical perspectives on movement and computing
- Robotics
- Sensory augmentation of movement
- Sensorimotor learning
- Surveillance and biometrics
- Tangible interaction
- Technique analysis
- Theoretical approaches to movement understanding
- Telepresence and togetherness
- Wearable devices for movement tracking, e.g., Apple Watch
- Topics of special relevance in 2022:
  - Artificial embodiment in online education, workspaces, and social gatherings
  - Telepresence
    - Via online hosting platforms, e.g., Zoom
    - Via physical devices, e.g., Beam
    - In live art and performance, e.g., NOWHERE
  - Social distancing and its impact on embodiment, movement, and computing systems

In order to support our interdisciplinary community, MOCO is open to a wide range of formats for presenting work. In addition to papers for oral and poster presentations, we invite submission of practice works such as demos, performances, games, artistic works and movement workshops. We are open to novel formats and we encourage submitters to be creative in proposals for practice sessions. We anticipate being able to provide limited support for student travel for accepted work across all categories. The submission categories are:

### Papers and posters

- Long paper with oral presentation (8 pages maximum)
- Short paper with oral presentation (4 pages maximum)
- Extended abstract with poster presentation (6 pages maximum in the extended abstract format)

The conference is an opportunity to present original research and details of collaborative work. Participants will have the chance to offer a presentation of the results of their research on one of the themes of the conference and to interact with their scientific/artistic peers in a friendly and constructive environment.

Three types of published submissions are accepted: long paper with oral presentation (8 pages maximum), short paper with oral presentation (4 pages maximum), extended abstract with poster presentation (6 pages maximum in the extended abstract format). All submissions should be original and anonymized and will be peer-reviewed in a double blind review process by members of the MOCO community. All submissions will receive at least two reviews which will be reviewed by the publications and proceedings chairs. Reviewers will allot 4-8 weeks for completing reviews. Minor revisions will be accepted.

### Practice Works

We deliberately use a very open term – “practice work” – to encourage diverse ideas of what practice in movement and computing is – and could be – and how such practice can be presented. We suggest the following as examples of what a practice work might be, but also stress that the list is not exhaustive and other types of presentation can be considered, the only criteria being excellence of the work and appropriateness to the conference theme. MOCO has limited means to present live work. Accepted Practice Works that require significant resources, time, and/or space will need to be presented in alternative formats, e.g. video, structured discussion, or at independent or remote venues that can be made accessible to MOCO attendees.

Suggested practice work formats:

- ARTWORKS
  - Live performances
    - Dance
    - Music
    - Theater
    - Performance art
    - Internet-based performance
  - Installations
    - Interactive installations
    - Projections
    - Kinetic sculptures
    - Virtual reality and immersive video
- DEMOS
  - Games
  - Technology demonstrations
    - Movement tracking systems
    - Wearables
    - Robotics
  - Video presentations
- WORKSHOPS
  - Open-ended movement improvisations
  - Movement choirs
  - Physical practice sessions or tutorials

Practice Works Submissions consist of:

1. An extended abstract (2 pages minimum, 6 pages maximum). _This document will be published in the conference proceedings for accepted papers and should be a standalone description of the work, including relevant references._
2. Supporting media (videos, pictures, audio) needed to explain the contribution of the work. _Please list prior presentations of the practice work and articulate how this presentation will be distinct._
3. Optional: Detailed technical requirements and possible additional information. _Accepted works will be required to fill out this information in a site-specific technical rider that will be emailed to authors following acceptance._

All submissions should be original and will be peer-reviewed by the MOCO community.

Please note that we are an academic conference with a relatively low registration fee, which means we cannot pay for commissioned performances and art works.

### Doctoral Consortium

The Doctoral Consortium is an opportunity for graduate students to present their work-in-progress on their advanced studies, especially their terminal degree, e.g., doctorate or MFA, to share and develop their research ideas in a supportive environment with participation from experts in the field. Students will have the opportunity to establish a community with other graduate students at a similar stage of their research.

Accepted students will give an oral presentation in a dedicated session. We encourage students to submit a description of their doctoral work even if they are at an early stage. Videos and other supplementary materials are welcomed and encouraged. Students accepted to present their work at the Doctoral Consortium must plan to attend.

Submissions consist of:

1. An extended abstract (400-800 words) describing the graduate work towards an advanced degree. Accepted abstracts will appear in the conference program.
2. Optional: Supporting media (videos, pictures, audio) that help explain the contribution of the work.

### Submission Format and Procedure

All submissions should be in pdf format and should use the ACM proceedings format:
http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template

All submissions must be made through EasyChair:
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=moco22

All papers submissions must be as anonymous as possible, including references that may reveal the author(s). The MOCO conference proceedings will be indexed and published in the ACM digital library.

### Special Events

At this year's MOCO, award-winning artist Yanira Castro is creating a piece that is inspired by the Puerto Rican güiro (a percussive instrument) and apito (a whistle) used in improvisational jibaro music. Her work and process exploring artificial embodiment will be featured at this year's conference.

Additionally, extending our approach from SloMoCo (hosted over the course of 2021), in person and virtual attendance options will be offered in sync and out of sync with the live conference program.
