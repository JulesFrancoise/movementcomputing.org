### 5th International Conference on Movement and Computing
### 28th-30th June 2018, Genoa, Italy.
### >> [MOCO'18 Website](http://moco18.movementcomputing.org/) <<

We would like to invite submissions to the 5th International Conference on Movement and Computing (MOCO’18), Genoa, Italy, June 28-30, 2018. Contributions can be submitted to three different tracks: Papers and Posters, Practice Works, and Doctoral Consortium. MOCO is an interdisciplinary conference that explores how computer science and technology can contribute to a deeper understanding of human movement practice, to support and facilitate movement expression and communication, and to design and develop new paradigms for interacting with computers through movement (e.g., movement interfaces). This requires to tackle computational challenges, including modeling, representation, segmentation, recognition, classification, and generation of movement information. To this aim, an interdisciplinary approach to movement understanding, ranging from biomechanics to embodied cognition, to the phenomenology of bodily experience as well as contributions from the performing arts is needed. We invite submissions from a wide range of disciplines including, but not limited to: Human-Machine Interaction, Artificial Intelligence, Affective Computing, Social Signal Processing, Machine Learning, Cognitive Science, Neuroscience, Psychology, Philosophy, Anthropology, Sports Sciences, Dance, Music, Visual Arts, Games, Healthcare, and Animation.

### Tracks

MOCO is open to a wide range of ways of presenting your work. Besides papers for oral and poster presentation, we invite submission of practice works such as demos, performances, games, artistic works and movement workshops (in which participants take part in a guided movement activity).

#### Papers and Posters

The conference is an opportunity to present original research and details of collaborative work. Participants will have the opportunity to offer a presentation of the results of their research on one of the themes of the conference and to interact with their scientific/artistic peers, in a friendly and constructive environment. We encourage submission of a wide range of formats.

__The submission categories are:__

- Long paper with oral presentation (8 pages maximum)
- Short paper with oral presentation (4 pages maximum)
- Extended abstract with poster presentation (6 pages maximum in the extended abstract format)

Authors of papers and posters may submit an accompanying demonstration proposal in addition to their regular paper or poster submission, by completing the proposal form for practice works (see items 2 and 3 in the next section) and sending it along with their submission. Together with the form, authors have to provide a link to a video about their work. The proposal form for practice works is mandatory for all paper and poster submissions including an accompanying demonstration and must include details about technical set-up and space requirements.

#### Practice Works

We deliberately use a very open term – “practice work” – to encourage diverse ideas of what practice in movement and computing is and how such practice can be presented. We suggest the following as examples of what a practice work might be, but also stress that the list is not exhaustive and any types of presentation can be considered, the only criteria being excellence of the work and whether it is possible to stage the work given the resources, time and space available to the conference.

__Suggested practice works topics:__

- Technology demos
- Performances (e.g., dance, physical performance, music)
- Artworks
- Interactive Installations
- Movement workshops (i.e., a session in which participants engage in movement based activity)
- Games
- Video presentations

__Submissions consist of:__

- An extended abstract (2 pages maximum).
- The proposal form for practice work, including detailed technical requirements and possible additional information. The form is available here (Ms Excel format) or here (OpenOffice format) .
- Supporting media (videos, pictures, audio, and so on), which should provide an overview of the practical work and details of the practical and technical requirements for putting the work on (this is very important to ensure that we can accommodate the work within the resources of our conference).

Please note that we are an academic conference with a low fee, which means we cannot pay for commissioned performances and artworks. In addition, we cannot guarantee facilities and technical support for all possible sessions, so please give us full details of your needs in the proposal form so that we can judge whether it is feasible.

#### Doctoral Consortium

Doctoral papers are an opportunity for PhD students to present their work in progress on their doctorate, share and develop their research ideas in a supportive environment and with the participation of experts in the field. Students will have the opportunity to establish a community, together with other doctoral students at a similar stage of their research. Accepted papers will have an oral presentation in a dedicated session. We encourage students to submit a paper even if they are early in their doctoral work.
Papers should not be longer than 4 pages including the references. The first author must be an actual PhD student. Doctoral Consortium papers will be indexed and published in the ACM digital library. Videos and other supplementary materials are highly welcomed. Students accepted to present their work at the Doctoral Consortium must plan to attend it.

### Submission Format and Procedure

Accepted submissions are:

- Long paper with oral presentation (8 pages maximum, including references)
- Short paper with oral presentation (4 pages maximum, including references)
- Extended abstract with poster presentation (6 pages maximum in the extended abstract format, including references)

For submission instructions and templates, see: http://moco18.movementcomputing.org/instructions.html

All contributions must be submitted online through EasyChair:
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=moco2018.

All submissions must be anonymous and will be peer-reviewed.
The MOCO proceedings will be indexed and published in the ACM digital library.
