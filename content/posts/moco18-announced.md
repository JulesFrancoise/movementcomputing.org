We are thrilled to announce that MOCO'18, the 5th International Conference on Movement and Computing, will be held at Casa Paganini - InfoMus in Genoa, Italy, in June 2018.

MOCO'18 will be organized by [Casa Paganini](www.casapaganini.org) - InfoMus research centre of DIBRIS - University of Genova, Italy. Casa Paganini – InfoMus originated from InfoMus Lab, a laboratory established since 1984 at University of Genova. The research centre carries on scientific research and design, development, and experimentation of multimodal interactive systems. Main research addresses computational models of nonverbal multimodal expressive and social communication, with special focus on human movement and gesture (e.g., dance, full-body movements), audio (e.g., music), expressive and tangible multimodal interfaces.
