15-17th July, Jersey City, NJ

In collaboration with our hosts, [Mana Contemporary](https://www.manacontemporary.com/), organizing institutions Rutgers University and Stevens Institute of Technology are pleased to announce the seventh international symposium on Movement and Computing.

We would like to invite submissions for paper presentations, performances, workshops and more to the 7th International Conference on Movement and Computing (MOCO) which is to be held 15-17th July in Jersey City, NJ.

### Important Dates

- Submission deadline: 19 February 2020
- Notification of Acceptance: 15 April 2020
- Registration starts: 1 May 2020

Information about previous conferences can be found [here](https://movementcomputing.org).

### Submissions

MOCO is open to a wide range of ways to present your work. In addition to papers for oral and poster presentations, we invite submission of a wide range of practice work such as demos, performances, games, artistic works and movement workshops (in which participants take part in a guided movement activity). We encourage submitters to be creative in proposals for practice sessions and are open to novel formats.

Topics Include but are not limited to (Bolded means new to this year):

- Dance and technology
- Interactive dance
- Music and movement
- Gesture and sound
- Entrainment and movement
- Sensory augmentation of movement
- Sensorimotor learning
- Embodied cognition and movement
- Embodied interaction
- **Full body interaction**
- Technique analysis
- **Individual and group movement capture in sports**
- Mechanisms of coordination dynamics
- Learning detection through the movement
- **Non-linear analysis to predict performance and learning process**
- Non-linear analysis as a tool for diagnosis
- Movement in social interaction
- **Movement and computing for autism and other nervous disorders**
- Movement analysis and analytics
- **Bio-sensing, biocontrol and movement**
- **Digital biomarkers for tracking the peripheral nervous system**
- **Movement as a proxy of human brain**
- Machine learning for movement
- Movement computation for entrainment
- Movement computation in education
- Movement computation in ergonomics, sports, and health
- Movement expression in virtual humans and robots
- Theoretical approaches to movement understanding
- Philosophical perspectives on movement and computing
- Movement Notation Systems (e.g. Laban or Eshkol-Wachman)

We encourage submission of a wide range of formats, the submission categories are:

### Papers and posters

- Long paper with oral presentation (8 pages maximum)
- Short paper with oral presentation (4 pages maximum)
- Extended abstract with poster presentation (6 pages maximum in the extended abstract format)

The conference is an opportunity to present original research and details of collaborative work. Participants will have the chance to offer a presentation of the results of their research on one of the themes of the conference and to interact with their scientific/artistic peers, in a friendly and constructive environment.

All papers submissions must be anonymous and will be peer-reviewed.

### Practice Works

We deliberately use a very open term – “practice work” – to encourage diverse ideas of what practice in movement and computing is and how such practice can be presented. We suggest the following as examples of what a practice work might be, but also stress that the list is not exhaustive and any types of presentation can be considered, the only criteria being excellence of the work and whether it is possible to stage the work given the resources, time and space available to the conference.

Suggested practice work topics:

- Technology demos
- Performances (e.g., dance, physical performance, music)
- Artworks
- Interactive Installations
- Movement workshops (i.e., a session in which participants engage in movement based activity)
- Games
- Video presentations

Submissions consist of:

1. An extended abstract (2 pages maximum).
2. The proposal form for practice work, including detailed technical requirements and possible additional information. The form is available as (Ms Excel format) or here (OpenOffice format).
3. Supporting media (videos, pictures, audio, and so on), which should provide an overview of the practical work and details of the practical and technical requirements for putting the work on (this is very important to ensure that we can accommodate the work within the resources of our conference).

Practice works will be juried from either the scientific or artistic committee. The authors will have to define if their work aims at developing some scientific or artistic work at the time of submission.

Please note that we are an academic conference with a low fee which means we cannot pay for commissioned performances and art work. Also, we cannot guarantee facilities for all possible sessions, so please give full details of your needs in the proposal form so we can judge whether it is possible.

### Doctoral Consortium

Doctoral papers are an opportunity for PhD students to present their work in progress on their doctorate, share and develop their research ideas in a supportive environment and with the participation of experts in the field. Students will have the opportunity to establish a community, together with other doctoral students at a similar stage of their research. Accepted papers will have an oral presentation in a dedicated session. We encourage students to submit a paper even if they are early in their doctoral work.

Papers should not be longer than 4 pages including references. The first author must be an actual PhD student. Doctoral Consortium papers will be indexed and published in the ACM digital library. Videos and other supplementary materials are highly welcomed. Students accepted to present their work at the Doctoral Consortium must plan to attend it.

### Submission Format and Procedure

All submissions should be in pdf format and should use the ACM proceedings format:

http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template

All submissions must be made through EasyChair https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=moco20

All papers submissions must be anonymous. The MOCO proceedings will be indexed and published in the ACM digital library.
